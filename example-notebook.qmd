## Quarto

Testing

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

#dont start scripts like - make new projects
#rm(list = ls())  - doesnt remove packages and environmental variables
#setwd() - directory name is not reproducible. 

#Project - allows you to not setwd

1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

mtcars |> ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
